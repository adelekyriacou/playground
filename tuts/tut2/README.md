#Tutorial 2

* Create a web page with four `<p>` elements and a button. On clicking the button a javascript function `getElements()` should be invoked, which loops through all the `<p>` elements on the page and displays each element object in a pop up window.

* Add a text entry element, a button and a h1 element to the web page created in Question 1. On clicking the button a javascript function `newHeading()` should be  invoked to replace the text between `<h1>`  tags with the text entered into the text entry element. 

* Create a web form with a text entry element (to enable the user to enter a phone number) and a button. When the user enters a phone number and presses the button a Javascript function called `checkPhoneNumber()` should be invoked to check that only numbers are entered. The phone maximum length of the phone number should be 14. If this is not the case, a message should be displayed directly under the text entry element to alert the user to the error.
