Tutorial 4 - DOM


Create a text entry form element with a button so that when the button is   
pressed the text between the <h1> tags is replaced with the text entered  
into the text entry field.



On the same page create two text entry fields and a button, so that when 
the button is pressed a function is invoked which dynamically generates 
a table with two columns. Each data cell of the table should contain the 
text which entered into the text entry fields.


Create another button on the same page, so that when this button is 
pressed,  a function is invoked which generates a list. The list items 
should be composed of the text which is entered into the text entry 
field.
